Fork Blender For Unreal Engine from  **xavier150**.

# Add Auto Import to Unreal after Export.
## Tested on Blender 4.2 and Unreal Engine 4.27 on Windows.
### Should work fine with other UE versions that supported by original repo.
Made because send2ue from EpicGames doesn't work with UE 4.27 and Blender 4.2 combination.

 If **Assets Import** checked, exported objects will be automatically imported in UE.
